Text - Item: Pemmican (or some varient) was used by many hunter / gatherer societies.  It was the perfect survival food, packing plenty of protein and calories into a food that was easy to make, easy to carry and would not spoil for months or years.

Text - Recipe: Dry three pieces of lean meat over your campfire, while your berries dry on a stone (or use the tin can).  When these items are dry, grind them into powder / very small pieces.  Render your animal fat in the tin can.  Mix your dry, powdered meat and berries into the liquid tallow, and allow to cool.
